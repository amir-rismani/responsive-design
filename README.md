## Tips
- The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
- The `http-equiv=”X-UA-Compatible”` tag is only relevant for Internet Explorer. All modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, will simply ignore this tag. However, it’s a good practice to include this tag in web projects that might still need to support older systems.
- The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
