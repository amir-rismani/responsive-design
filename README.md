## Tips
### Basic HTML and CSS
- The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the `UTF-8` character set. `UTF-8` covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
- The `http-equiv=”X-UA-Compatible”` tag is only relevant for Internet Explorer. All modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, will simply ignore this tag. However, it’s a good practice to include this tag in web projects that might still need to support older systems.
- The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
- The term `HTML Entity` is used as a synonym for a character reference — a pattern of characters that can represent another character in the HTML. For example, `&lt;` is used to represent the less-than symbol (`<`) in HTML content.
- The `object-fit` CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <`img`> or <`video`>, should be resized to fit its container.
- The `border-collapse` CSS property sets whether cells inside a `<`table`> have shared or separate borders.
- HTML (`HyperText Markup Language`) elements historically were categorized as either **"block-level" elements** or **"inline" elements**. As a presentational characteristic, this is now specified by CSS. The paragraph (`<p>`) elements are block-level by default. That is why they are displayed in block layout.
- Semantic elements clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.
- The <`em`> element is for words that have a **stressed emphasis** compared to surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a sentence and affects the **meaning of the sentence** itself.
- The <`strong`> HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
- The <`article`> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
- The <`figure`> HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <`figcaption`> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
- The <`header`> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
- The <`main`> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <`body`> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application. A document mustn't have more than one <`main`> element that doesn't have the hidden attribute specified.
- The <`footer`> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <`footer`> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
- The <`nav`> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
-The <`section`> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
- If the contents of the element represent a standalone, atomic unit of content that makes sense syndicated as a standalone piece (e.g. a blog post or blog comment, or a newspaper article), the <`article`> element would be a better choice.
